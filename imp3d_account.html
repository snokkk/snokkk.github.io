            <h2>Deleting data (account) from Imposter 3D game</h2>
            <p style="color: red">THIS ACTION CANNOT BE UNDONE.</p>
            <p style="color: red">IF YOU DELETE AN ACCOUNT, YOU CAN'T GET IT BACK.</p>
            <p>You can delete an account (and all of its data) in Imposter 3D in two ways.</p>
            <p>1. In the game itself, open the online menu (the "play online" button in the game). Then click the "Profile" button and then "Delete Account". After confirming the deletion, the account and all the data will be deleted instantly.</p>
                <p>(this method works since the game version 9.3.9)</p>
            <p>2. If you do not have the game installed, you can delete your account by writing to us at snowbatstudio@gmail.com.
                In the letter you need to specify - LOGIN from the game, which you used for registration and additional information (to confirm that it's really you). Additional information may be: a nickname from the game, the approximate last date of login to the game, 
                the approximate number of coins.</p>
            <p>Example letter:
                "Hi, I want to delete my account from Imposter 3D game. My login is "justplayer", my in-game nickname is "astronaut123"." </p>
            <p>Deleting an account this way can take up to 5 business days.</p>
