            <p>If we use Cookies by our web-site so the Third-Party Providers by our Product will at times place and/or store code or other types of information and/or software on your Device or within your browser, such as cookies (including flash cookies), locally shared objects, and HTML5 (collectively, &laquo;Local Device Storage&raquo;).</p>
            <p>We and Third-Party Providers may use Local Device Storage in connection with the Product for any lawful business purpose, including without limitation to determine whether you have seen a particular advertisement before on the same or different Device and to otherwise control the display of ads, to track the movements of individual users through the Product and elsewhere on the web or across apps, devices, and geographic locations, to help diagnose problems with servers, to gather broad demographic information, to conduct research, to deliver editorial content, to record registration and personalization information, and to otherwise administer the Product. For example, if you register on any part of the Third-Party Providers&apos; products and are given the option to save your user&rsquo;s name and password, Third-Party Providers may provide this convenience to you via Local Device Storage. Local Device Storage may also collect and store your PII, which may be shared with our parent, subsidiaries, affiliates, and other third parties.</p>
            <p>When we use Cookies so we will ask your permission for this on our web-site.</p>
            <p><br></p>
            <p><br></p>
            <p><strong>6.2. You May Disable Local Device Storage.</strong></p>
            <p>If you do not want Local Device Storage, your Device or browser may include an option that allows you to not accept it. However, if you disable Local Device Storage, some portions of the Product may not function properly.</p>
            <p><br></p>
            <p><strong>6.3. Tracking Technologies.</strong></p>

Third Party uses Tracking Technologies to determine which of our messages have been opened by recipients, and for all or some of the same lawful business purposes, we describe above for use of Local Device Storage.</p>

            <p><strong>6.4. Do Not Track (DNT).</strong></p>
            <p>Your browser setting may allow you to automatically transmit a &laquo;Do Not Track&raquo; (DNT) signal to websites and online services that you visit. There is no consensus among industry participants as to what DNT means in this context, and some browsers automatically apply DNT signals by default and therefore do not necessarily reflect our visitors&rsquo; choice as to whether they wish to receive advertisements tailored to their interests. As a result, like many websites and online services, we do not alter our practices when the Product receives a DNT signal from a visitor&apos;s browser. As discussed below, you may opt-out of the use of your Data for online behavioral advertising by third parties at any time. To find out more about DNT, please visit <a href="http://allaboutdnt.com"><span style="color: #0b4cb4;">http://allaboutdnt.com</span></a>&nbsp;</p>

            <p><br></p>
            <p><strong>7.1. How OBA Works.</strong></p>
            <p>Third-Party Providers will at times also use Tracking Technologies for purposes of &laquo;online behavioral advertising&raquo; (OBA). OBA allows the serving of advertisements tailored to interests you have shown by browsing on the Product and other sites, applications, destinations, and services, using the same or a different Device. To enable OBA, these Third-Party Providers use Tracking Technologies to collect Data including for example the make, model, settings, specifications (e.g., CPU speed, connection speed, browser type, operating system, device identifier), and geographic location of your Device, as well as date/time stamp, IP address, pages visited, time of visits, Content viewed, ads viewed, the site(s), application(s), destination(s), and/or service(s) you arrived from, and other clickstream data. The use of Tracking Technologies by Third-Party Providers is subject to their privacy policies, not this Privacy Policy, and we have no responsibility or liability in connection therewith. You may visit Third-Party Providers&apos; sites and discover their privacy policies.</p>
            <p><br></p>
            <p><strong>7.2. Opt-Out of OBA.</strong></p>
            <p>If you do not want OBA at all, you may be able to opt-out by visiting <a href="http://www.aboutads.info"><span style="color: #0b4cb4;">http://www.aboutads.info</span></a><a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org"><span style="color: #0b4cb4;">http://www.networkadvertising.org</span></a><a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.com/uk"><span style="color: #0b4cb4;">http://www.youronlinechoices.com/uk</span></a> аnd/or by clicking the &ldquo;Ad Choices&rdquo; icon that appears in advertising served through OBA. Please note that the option to opt-out applies only to tracking by Third-Party Providers across this Product and other sites, applications, destinations, and services, and not tracking among pages within the Product itself.</p>

            <p><strong>9.2. No Liability for Breach.</strong></p>
