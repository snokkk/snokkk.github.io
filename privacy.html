For example, if you register on any part of the Third-Party Providers&apos; products and are given the option to save your user&rsquo;s name and password, Third-Party Providers may provide this convenience to you via Local Device Storage. Local Device Storage may also collect and store your PII, which may be shared with our parent, subsidiaries, affiliates, and other third parties.</p>

            <p><br></p>

            <p><strong>6.2. You May Disable Local Device Storage.</strong></p>
            <p>If you do not want Local Device Storage, your Device or browser may include an option that allows you to not accept it. However, if you disable Local Device Storage, some portions of the Product may not function properly.</p>
            <p><br></p>
            <p><strong>6.3. Tracking Technologies.</strong></p>
            <p>In addition to Local Device Storage, Third Party may use web beacons, web bugs, internet or pixel tags, clear gifs, digital fingerprinting (aka &laquo;Machine Identification&raquo;), and similar technologies (collectively, together with Local Device Storage, the &laquo;Tracking Technologies&raquo;) on the Product and in our communications with you, such as within email and text messages and push notifications. Third Party uses Tracking Technologies to determine which of our messages have been opened by recipients, and for all or some of the same lawful business purposes, we describe above for use of Local Device Storage.</p>
            <p><br></p>
            <p><strong>6.4. Do Not Track (DNT).</strong></p>
            <p>Your browser setting may allow you to automatically transmit a &laquo;Do Not Track&raquo; (DNT) signal to websites and online services that you visit. There is no consensus among industry participants as to what DNT means in this context, and some browsers automatically apply DNT signals by default and therefore do not necessarily reflect our visitors&rsquo; choice as to whether they wish to receive advertisements tailored to their interests. As a result, like many websites and online services, we do not alter our practices when the Product receives a DNT signal from a visitor&apos;s browser. As discussed below, you may opt-out of the use of your Data for online behavioral advertising by third parties at any time. To find out more about DNT, please visit <a href="http://allaboutdnt.com"><span style="color: #0b4cb4;">http://allaboutdnt.com</span></a>.&nbsp;</p>

            <p><strong>7. Online Behavioral Advertising (OBA) and How to Opt-Out of OBA</strong></p>
            <p><br></p>
            <p><strong>7.1. How OBA Works.</strong></p>
            <p>Third-Party Providers will at times also use Tracking Technologies for purposes of &laquo;online behavioral advertising&raquo; (OBA). OBA allows the serving of advertisements tailored to interests you have shown by browsing on the Product and other sites, applications, destinations, and services, using the same or a different Device. To enable OBA, these Third-Party Providers use Tracking Technologies to collect Data including for example the make, model, settings, specifications (e.g., CPU speed, connection speed, browser type, operating system, device identifier), and geographic location of your Device, as well as date/time stamp, IP address, pages visited, time of visits, Content viewed, ads viewed, the site(s), application(s), destination(s), and/or service(s) you arrived from, and other clickstream data. The use of Tracking Technologies by Third-Party Providers is subject to their privacy policies, not this Privacy Policy, and we have no responsibility or liability in connection therewith. You may visit Third-Party Providers&apos; sites and discover their privacy policies.</p>
            <p><br></p>
            <p><strong>7.2. Opt-Out of OBA.</strong></p>
            <p>If you do not want OBA at all, you may be able to opt-out by visiting <a href="http://www.aboutads.info"><span style="color: #0b4cb4;">http://www.aboutads.info</span></a>, <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org"><span style="color: #0b4cb4;">http://www.networkadvertising.org</span></a>, <a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.com/uk"><span style="color: #0b4cb4;">http://www.youronlinechoices.com/uk</span></a> аnd/or by clicking the &ldquo;Ad Choices&rdquo; icon that appears in advertising served through OBA. Please note that the option to opt-out applies only to tracking by Third-Party Providers across this Product and other sites, applications, destinations, and services, and not tracking among pages within the Product itself.</p>

            <p><strong>8. Transfer of Your Data Among Jurisdictions</strong></p>
            <p>We are a Russia-based but our Product is geared to a worldwide audience. Your Data may be processed, transferred to, and maintained on, servers and databases located within the European Union, and U.S., and elsewhere where the privacy laws may not be as protective as your jurisdiction.

            <p><strong>9.2. No Liability for Breach.</strong></p>
            <p>Because no data transmission is completely secure, and no system of physical or electronic security is impenetrable, we cannot guarantee the security of the Data that you send to us or the security of servers, networks or databases, and by using the Product you agree to assume all risk in connection with your Data. We are not responsible for any loss of such Data or the consequences thereof.</p>
            <p><br></p>
            <p><strong>9.3. Breach Notification.</strong></p>
            <p>If we believe the security of your PII in our possession or control may have been compromised, we may seek to notify you. If notification is appropriate, we may notify you by email, push notification, or otherwise.</p>
            <p><br></p>
            <p><strong>10. Your Data protection rights under General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</strong></p>
            <p>10.1. If you are from the European Economic Area (EEA), our and Third parties&apos; legal basis for collecting and using the personal information described in this Privacy Policy depends on the PII we collect and the specific context in which we collect it.</p>

            <p>- We and (or) Third parties need to perform an agreement with you;</p>
            <p>- You have given us permission to do so;</p>
            <p>- The processing is in our legitimate interests and it&apos;s not overridden by your rights;</p>
            <p>- To comply with the law.</p>
            <p>11.2. If you are a resident of the European Economic Area (EEA), you have certain data protection rights. We and Third parties aim to take reasonable steps to allow you to correct, amend, delete, or limit the use of your PII.</p>

            <p><strong>b) Your right to rectification</strong></p>
            <p>If the PII we hold about you is inaccurate or incomplete, you are entitled to have it rectified.

            <p><strong>c) Your right to erasure</strong></p>
            <p>You can ask us to delete or remove your PII in some circumstances, such as where we no longer need it or where you withdraw your consent (where applicable).

            <p><strong>e) Your right to object</strong></p>
            <p>You can ask us to stop processing your PII, and we will do so, if we are: (i) relying on our own or someone else&apos;s legitimate interest to process your PII, except if we can demonstrate compelling legal grounds for the processing; or (ii) processing your PII for direct marketing purposes.</p>

            <p><br></p>
            <p><strong>13.2. Shine the Light.</strong></p>
            <p>California&apos;s &ldquo;Shine the Light: law, Civil Code Section 1798.83, gives California customers the right to prevent the disclosure of their personal information to third parties for those third parties&apos; direct marketing purposes and requires certain businesses to respond to requests from California customers asking about the business&apos; practices related to disclosing personal information to third parties for the third parties direct marketing purposes.

If you fit that description and posted Content on a section of our Product that is directed to minors, you may request the removal of the Content by contacting our Privacy Policy Coordinator as described below. In response to your request, we may elect to make the Content invisible to other users and the public (rather than deleting it entirely), in which case the Content may remain on servers we control and/or maybe publicly available elsewhere if a third party copied and reposted the Content.</p>
            <p><br></p>
